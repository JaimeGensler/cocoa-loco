#### _A website for an imaginary hot cocoa bar- now with state! - Feb. 16, 2020_

#### By _Jaime Gensler_

## Description

_Cocoa Loco is a single page website built with React. It utilizes client-side routing and allows you to view different options for cocoa drinks! Features white chocolate cocoa, milk chocolate cocoa, and (the objectively superior in every single way) dark chocolate cocoa. Add your own bevvy with the new and improved version, using state (wow!). Note - bevvies with <40% cocoa content are considered white chocolate, 40-60% are considered milk, and >60% are considered dark._
